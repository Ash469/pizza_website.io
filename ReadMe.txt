Website is Fully Responsive You can test on any device.

Routing path :- FrontPage -> Menu Page <-> Cart Page.

There is a Dedicated error page for 404 and 500.

I also implement local stroage so you cart item is safe even if you reload the site.

There is feature to increment or decrement quantity of particular item in cart.

The Footer show total number of item and calculate total price dynamically.

There is feature that svg of bag changes to tick marked if item is present in cart.

Like that cart svg will change to fill when any item present in the cart.
